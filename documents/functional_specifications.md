# Personaes

## Lorena, Novice

TODO

## Herbert, Conductor

Herbert, 46, has been conducting the Shenron orchestra for the last 5 years.
His experience allows him to detect even the slightest mistake in the performance.

Even then, Herbert would like a portable tool to tell him which instruments plays.
With it, he could know who is missing without having to look at everyone.

He also thinks it could help his students train regonizing the instruments by themself.

## Maximilian, Lover

Maximilian is a 22 years old young man studying law.
He secretly loves his musician neighbor and decided to ask her our.

To make a good impression, he wants to learn more about her. But he has no idea what instrument she plays.

To not ruin the effect of surprise, he chooses to not ask her friends and instead rely only on himself. He needs some application to help him fill his lack of knowledge.

Altough he loves listening to her play, he has no way to record her other than his phone.
