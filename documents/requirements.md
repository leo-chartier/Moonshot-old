# Moonshot project

[ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/) is a programming school with a curriculum spanning 3 to 5 years.
As part of their grading process, they include a big project, named the "**Moonshot project**".

This project is supported to be personal (each student has a different one) and of a high enough difficulty for the student to be challenged and pushed to their limit. This allows ALGOSUP to evaluate the true potential of their students and the result of the years of training.



# This project

For my project, I ([LÃ©o CHARTIER](https://github.com/leo-chartier)) decided to choose the topic of music.

We all know [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/). Created in 2002 and now owned by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), this application allows any of its 300 million users to identify any music and even movie or TV show, simply by recording a sound sample.

Although software can recognize easily a piece of music or its melody, none actually recognize the instruments that are being played.
This is what the goal of this project will be.



# Requirements

The requirements are, in order of priority, the following:

## Mobile application
- Functional requirement

This software should result in a working mobile application.

The main target is Android as it composes over 70% of the market shares as well as being what I personally use.
IOS and PCs are currently not planned.

## Input
- Functional requirement

The user should be able to record sound with their microphone or directly use a pre-recorded sound.

## Usage
- Functional requirement

That the app should be intuitive so that anyone of any age can use it easily.

## Budget
- Business requirement

Being a school project, the budget for this should remain low or even be null.

Further decisions must be made to clarify this point.

## Offline
- Functional requirements

The application should work even without an internet connection.

If heavy calculations require a server, this point may be revised.

## Performance
- Non-functional requirement

Exact performance limits TBD.

## Aesthetic
- Non-functional requirement

For the user to be inclined to use the app and for them to come back, the application should be pleasing to look at.
